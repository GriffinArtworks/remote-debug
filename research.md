**Chrome for Android**

- Implements the [Remote Debugging Protocol](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/protocol/1.0/index) over a WebSocket connection

**iOS 6 & Safari Web Inspector**

- iOS 6 & Safari seem to communicate via the `ubd` process, which is the Ubiquity daemon.
- The port that's consistently listed my machine is 64880.
- This conneciton exists when Safari is active, even when no remote debugging is taking place.
- Another connection seems to be set up when remote debugging another tab.

**Opera Mini & Dragonfly**

- Opening `opera:debug` on Opera Mini iOS fails, seems to not be implemented.
- The Opera Mobile Emulator works.
- Dragonkeeper acts as proxy between a host & client, designed to make developing Dragonfly itself easier.
- Got it to work so I could watch traffic between the emulator and the client. The [docs for doing so](https://github.com/operasoftware/dragonkeeper#howto) don't mention that you don't have to have a second instance of Opera, but can use the emulator too.

**General**

- Found [this Remote Debugging talk](http://thecssninja.com/talks/remote_debugging/) very useful for understanding where we stand now.
- Discovered the [WebDriver API] and the [BTTWG](http://www.w3.org/testing/browser/) â€“ perhaps any tool that pollyfills the above should conform to this spec.

**Dragonfly & Dragonkeeper**

- Looked into code to see what Dragonkeeper is doing with data to & from a device.
- Running dragonkeeper with -df gives a pretty-printed output nice output of what's being sent
- http://localhost:8002/services is being hit repeatedly hit until the device returns an xml list of services: [http://i.phuu.net/KAX1](http://i.phuu.net/KAX1)

**Firefox Beta**

- [Documentation](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Remote_Debugging_Protocol)
- An **actor** in an entity on the server (device) that can interact with the client (debugger) via a JSON protocol.
- The protocol consists of JSON packets:
  - Client to server: `{ "to": actor, "type": type, ... }`
  - Server to client: `{ "from": actor, ... }`
- A **grip** is a JSON representation of some value on the server

### Installing Firefox Beta & hooking up

- [The nightly Beta](http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mobile/nightly/latest-mozilla-central-android/) release APK for the emulator
- `adb install [path to above]`
- `adb forward tcp:6000 tcp:6000`
- Enable `devtools.debugger.remote-enabled` in client Firefox
- Disable `devtools.debugger.force-local` & enable `devtools.debugger.remote-enabled` in FF Beta on the device
- Restart all Firefoxes
- Open Tools > Web Developer > Remote Debugging & connect. Click OK on the device.
- If in Nightly, go Tools > W D > Connect

### Firefox Nightly connection code:

In Firefox, open:

- jar:file:///Applications/FirefoxNightly.app/Contents/MacOS/omni.ja!/

This file manages the connect page:

- jar:file:///Applications/FirefoxNightly.app/Contents/MacOS/omni.ja!/chrome/browser/content/browser/devtools/connect.js

Debug Clients JSM:

- jar:file:///Applications/FirefoxNightly.app/Contents/MacOS/omni.ja!/modules/devtools/dbg-client.jsm
